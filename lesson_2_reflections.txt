1. 	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
		It creates a .git directory that contains metadata about the version changes
		and contents of the repository. 
		The reason you need to do it is that without it Git would not work.
2. 	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 	 What value do you think it offers?
		The staging area is between the working directory and the repository. Files are selected for a commit from the working directory and added to the staging area. 
		This allows the user control over what is added to the commit. If a small change was made to a few files, the entier project does not need to be added.
