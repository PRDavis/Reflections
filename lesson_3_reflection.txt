1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
      When I work on it from different computers or if others are also working on it. Also, 
      it keeps a seperate copy - like a backup.
2.	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
	stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
		If you do it manually,  you have control over what is introduced to the local repository.
